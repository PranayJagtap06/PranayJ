    👨🏼‍💻 I'm an <strong>Electrical Engineer</strong> with an academic foundation from 🏛️ Nagpur University , I've developed a passion for 🐍 Python 
    and a fascination with the vast potential of 🤖 Machine Learning. I'm now eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to transition into
    a career in machine learning, where I can apply my analytical mindset and creativity to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact.
    With foundation in machine learning, I've had the opportunity to work with a range of cutting-edge libraries, including <strong>Scikit-Learn,
    Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn</strong>. Through hands-on experience, I've developed a comprehensive skill set that enables me to tackle 
    complex data challenges, from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model selection and evaluation. I'm now expanding my expertise by exploring 
    the capabilities of TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework. As a committed lifelong learner, I'm dedicated to continually refining my skills 
    and applying them to drive meaningful impact in real-world scenarios.

    I enjoy writing <strong>useful and reusable code and apps</strong> to ease work and help others - check out <a href="/_portfolios/">my projects</a> and <a href="https://github.com/PranayJagtap06/convertercalc_flutter">app</a> that I made. In a past few years I have become experienced with Python and Machine Learning.

    I'm fond of reading books, <strong>self-help</strong> any time and <strong>fiction</strong> sometimes. Though my favourite book is the Shiva Trilogy series by Amish Tripathi.
