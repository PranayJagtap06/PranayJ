  👨🏼‍💻 I'm a seasoned Electrical Engineer with an academic foundation from 🏛️ Nagpur University , I've developed a passion for 🐍 Python 
  and a fascination with the vast potential of 🤖 Machine Learning. I'm now eager to leverage my skills and knowledge to transition into
  a career in machine learning, where I can apply my analytical mindset and creativity to drive innovation and make a meaningful impact.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  With a strong foundation in machine learning, I've had the opportunity to work with a range of cutting-edge libraries, including Scikit-Learn,
  Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly, and Seaborn. Through hands-on experience, I've developed a comprehensive skill set that enables me to tackle 
  complex data challenges, from preprocessing and exploratory analysis to model selection and evaluation. I'm now expanding my expertise by exploring 
  the capabilities of TensorFlow, a leading deep learning framework. As a committed lifelong learner, I'm dedicated to continually refining my skills 
  and applying them to drive meaningful impact in real-world scenarios. Let's collaborate and explore the possibilities!
